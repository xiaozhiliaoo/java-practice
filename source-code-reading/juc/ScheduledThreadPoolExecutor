ScheduledFutureTask
DelayedWorkQueue


* Thread designated to wait for the task at the head of the
* queue.  This variant of the Leader-Follower pattern
* (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/POSA/POSA2/) serves to
* minimize unnecessary timed waiting.  When a thread becomes
* the leader, it waits only for the next delay to elapse, but
* other threads await indefinitely.  The leader thread must
* signal some other thread before returning from take() or
* poll(...), unless some other thread becomes leader in the
* interim.  Whenever the head of the queue is replaced with a
* task with an earlier expiration time, the leader field is
* invalidated by being reset to null, and some waiting
* thread, but not necessarily the current leader, is
* signalled.  So waiting threads must be prepared to acquire
* and lose leadership while waiting.
